# Rust-X-CPE-Internship
Rust Benin is partnering with the Department of Computer Engineering, UNIBEN to give the best programming experience in learning Rust.

The program promises to be impactful as wonderful and industry-expert mentors are already on ground. I will  be writing and documenting my journey

# Week 1: Rust Basics & Syntax
**Day 1-5:**

- Install Rust and set up the development environment.
- Learn basic syntax: variables, data types, functions, conditionals, loops.
- Project: Create a simple CLI calculator to practice basic operations and user input.
# Week 2: Structs, Enums, and Error Handling
