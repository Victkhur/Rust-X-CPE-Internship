# Rust-X-CPE-Internship
Rust Benin is partnering with the Department of Computer Engineering, UNIBEN to give the best programming experience in learning Rust.

The program promises to be impactful as wonderful and industry-expert mentors are already on ground. I will  be writing and documenting my journey

## Week 1: Rust Basics & Syntax
**Day 1-5:**

- Install Rust and set up the development environment.
- Learn basic syntax: variables, data types, functions, conditionals, loops.
- Project: Create a simple CLI calculator to practice basic operations and user input.
## Week 2: Structs, Enums, and Error Handling

**Day 8-9:**
- Learn about structs and enums.
- **Project:** Build a small inventory management system using structs and enums.

**Day 10-11:**
- Understand pattern matching and control flow.
- **Project:** Add pattern matching to the inventory system, allowing for item categorization.

**Day 12-14:**
- Deep dive into Rust's error handling with `Result` and `Option`.
- **Project:** Add error handling to the inventory, making it more robust.

## Week 3: Collections and Iterators

**Day 15-17:**
- Learn about vectors, hash maps, and strings.
- **Project:** Build a contact book app, allowing for the addition, removal, and search of contacts.

**Day 18-19:**
- Master iterators and closures.
- **Project:** Add sorting and filtering options to the contact book using iterators.

**Day 20-21:**
- Study traits and generics in Rust.
- **Project:** Refactor the contact book to make it more generic and reusable.

## Week 4: Async Programming and Concurrency

**Day 22-25:**
- Learn async programming with `tokio`.
- **Project:** Build an asynchronous web scraper that fetches and processes data from multiple websites concurrently.

**Day 26-28:**
- Study concurrency using threads.
- **Project:** Modify the web scraper to handle multiple scraping tasks concurrently.

## Week 5: Working with Files, Crates, and Modules

**Day 29-31:**
- Learn file I/O in Rust and how to use crates.
- **Project:** Build a log parser that reads logs from a file and generates a report.

**Day 32-34:**
- Learn about Rust modules and crate structures.
- **Project:** Refactor the log parser to be modular and scalable.
