# Ownership
Ownership in Rust defines who is responsible for managing the memory of a value (or resource). 
Every value in Rust has a single "owner," and when the owner goes out of scope, the value is automatically dropped (deallocated). 
Rust enforces strict ownership rules to ensure memory safety and avoid data races.

**Ownership Rules:**
- Each value in Rust has a single owner: Only one variable or entity can "own" a value at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped: Rust automatically frees the memory when the owner leaves the scope, preventing memory leaks.
- Ownership can be transferred: Ownership can be transferred (moved) to another variable, 
but once ownership is transferred, the original owner can no longer access the value.

**Example of Ownership:**
```
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello"); // s1 owns the String
    let s2 = s1;                    // ownership is moved to s2, s1 is no longer valid

    // println!("{}", s1);  // This would cause a compile-time error because s1 no longer owns the data.
    println!("{}", s2);      // s2 now owns the data
}
```
- In this example, ownership of the `String` is moved from `s1` to `s2`. 
Once `s2` takes ownership, `s1` is no longer valid, and trying to use it would result in a compile-time error.

# Borrowing
Borrowing allows you to access a value without taking ownership of it. When you borrow a value, you do not move the ownership; instead, you create a reference to the original ownerâ€™s value. There are two types of borrowing:

1. **Immutable borrowing** (`&T`): You can have many immutable references to a value.
2. **Mutable borrowing** (`&mut T`): Only one mutable reference can exist at a time, and there can't be any immutable references to the same value when a mutable reference exists.

**Example of Borrowing:**
**Immutable Borrowing:**
```
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    
    let len = calculate_length(&s1);  // borrow s1 (immutable)
    
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len); // s1 is still accessible here
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()  // since s is a reference, it does not own the value
}
```
**Mutable Borrowing:**
```
fn main() {
    let mut s1 = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s1);  // mutable borrow

    println!("{}", s1);  // s1 can still be used here after the mutable borrow
}

fn change(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str(", world");  // modifies the original string
}
```
