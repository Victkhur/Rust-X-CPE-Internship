# Data Type in Rust
Rust provides a wide variety of built-in types, including scalar types 
(integers, floats, booleans, and characters), compound types (tuples and arrays), and more. Every value in Rust has a specific data type known at compile time. 
This helps prevent many common programming errors and makes Rust both fast and reliable.
