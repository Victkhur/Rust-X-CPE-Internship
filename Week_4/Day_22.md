Async programming in Rust, especially using the Tokio library, is a powerful way to handle concurrent tasks efficiently.
# What is Async Programming?
Asynchronous programming allows you to write non-blocking, concurrent code that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously. 
Instead of waiting for one task to complete, the program can switch to another task, maximizing CPU and I/O efficiency. 
In Rust, async is particularly useful for I/O-bound operations, like networking or file handling.

# What is Tokio?
**Tokio** is a popular async runtime for Rust. It provides the infrastructure to run asynchronous code, including:

1. An **event loop** to manage tasks.
2. **Async I/O utilities** for networking, timers, and more.
3. **Task spawning** to run tasks concurrently.

# Key Concepts in Tokio
1 Async Functions (`async fn`)
    - Functions defined with `async fn` return a **future**, a value representing a computation that hasnâ€™t completed yet.
